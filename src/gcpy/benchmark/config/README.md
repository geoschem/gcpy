# README.md (gcpy/benchmark/config)

This directory contains configuration files (in YAML format) that control options for 1-month and 1-year benchmarks.  These files are used as input to the `run_benchmark.py` script (located one directory level above).

| File                         | Description |
| ----                         | ----------- |
| `1mo_benchmark.yml`          | Options for creating 1-month benchmark plots and tables (fullchem simulation) |
| `1yr_ch4_benchmark.yml`      | Options for creating 1-year benchmark plots and tables (CH4 simulation) |
| `1yr_fullchem_benchmark.yml` | Options for creating 1-year benchmark plots & tables (fullchem simulation)|
