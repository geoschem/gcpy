### Summary

This is the first labeled version of GCPy. The primary functionality of GCPy is plotting and tabling diagnostics from GEOS-Chem. Main features include:

- Functions for comparing GEOS-Chem benchmark output for multiple versions of GEOS-Chem, including 2D plots and mass and budget table creation.
- Support for plotting benchmark output for both GEOS-Chem Classic (lat/lon data) and GCHP (cubed-sphere data).
