# Support Guidelines

GCPy support is maintained by the **GEOS-Chem Support Team (GCST)**, which is based jointly at Harvard University and Washington University in St. Louis.

We track bugs, user questions, and feature requests through **[GitHub issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFBhdotYVf8)**. Please help out as you can in response to issues and user questions.

## How to report a bug
We use GitHub to track issues. To report a bug, **[open a new issue](https://github.com/geoschem/gcpy/issues/new/choose)**. Please include your name, institution, and all relevant information, such as simulation log files and instructions for replicating the bug.

## Where can I ask for help?
We use GitHub issues to support user questions. To ask a question, **[open a new issue](https://github.com/geoschem/gcpy/issues/new/choose)** and select the question template. Please include your name and institution in the issue.

## What type of support can I expect?

We will be happy to assist you in resolving bugs and technical issues that arise when using GCPy.  User support and outreach is an important part of our  mission to support the [International GEOS-Chem User Community](https://geoschem.github.io/geos-chem-people-projects-map/).

Even though we can assist in several ways, we cannot possibly do everything.  We rely on users being resourceful and willing to try to resolve problems on their own to the greatest extent possible.

If you have a science question rather than a technical question, you should contact the relevant [GEOS-Chem Working Group(s)](https://geos-chem.seas.harvard.edu/geos-working-groups) directly. But if you do not know whom to ask, you may open a new issue (See "Where can I ask for help" above) and we will be happy to direct your question to the appropriate person(s).
