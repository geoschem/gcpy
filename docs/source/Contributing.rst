Contribute to GCPy
==================

We welcome new code additions to GCPy in the form of `pull requests <https://github.com/geoschem/gcpy/pulls>`_.
If you have an example you would like to add to this ReadTheDocs site, you can add it to the ``examples`` folder in the GCPy repository
and submit a pull request with this added file. If you would like to suggest changes to the documentation on this site, you can do so by 
describing your changes in a Github issue or by directly editing the source RST files included in the GCPy repository 
and submitting a pull request with your changes.

We do not currently have an automated testing pipeline operational for GCPy. We ask that you test any changes by plotting / tabling relevant diagnostics
using one of the benchmark plotting scripts included in the ``benchmark`` folder of the repository, then verifying your results against the results
of the same script using an unchanged version of GCPy. Any further testing before finalizing 
your pull request is greatly appreciated.
