Report a Problem or Request a Feature
=====================================

If you encounter an error when using GCPy or if any documentation is unclear, you should 
`open a new issue on the GCPy Github page <https://github.com/geoschem/gcpy/issues/new/choose>`__.
Pre-defined templates exist for asking a question or reporting a bug / issue. 

We are open to adding new functionality to GCPy as requested by its userbase. Some requested functionality
may be better suited to example scripts rather than direct code additions to GCPy. In that case, we can add 
examples to the `Example Scripts` section of this ReadTheDocs site.
