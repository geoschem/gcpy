##############################

Welcome to the GCPy ReadTheDocs documentation! This site provides documentation
on the functionality of GCPy and instructions for common use cases.

**GCPy** is a Python-based toolkit containing useful functions for
working specifically with the **GEOS-Chem** model of atmospheric
chemistry and composition. GCPy is primarily used for plotting/tabling
GEOS-Chem output and regridding input files in special cases.

For documentation on setting up and running GEOS-Chem please see our
`list of manuals for GEOS-Chem and related software
