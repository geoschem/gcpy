================================

Welcome to the GCPy ReadTheDocs documentation! This site provides documentation
on the functionality of GCPy and instructions for common use cases.

**GCPy** is a Python-based toolkit containing useful functions for
working specifically with the **GEOS-Chem** model of atmospheric
chemistry and composition. GCPy is primarily used for plotting/tabling
GEOS-Chem output and regridding input files in special cases. For
documentation on setting up and running GEOS-Chem, please see the
`GEOS-Chem
Wiki <http://wiki.seas.harvard.edu/geos-chem/index.php/Main_Page>`__.
